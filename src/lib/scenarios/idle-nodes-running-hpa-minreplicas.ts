  category: "Interview Cheat-Sheet: Cost & Resource Optimization",
  content: `
* **Symptoms** – Cloud cost dashboard shows a steady increase in **EC2‑instance‑hours** even during off‑peak; \`kubectl get hpa\` shows \`minReplicas: 5\` for several micro‑services.
* **Items encountered** – HPA objects were created with a **static \`minReplicas\`** that never dropped below 5; the **Cluster Autoscaler** was disabled, so nodes never scaled down; there is a **DaemonSet** with \`runOnAllNodes: true\` that forces a node to stay alive.
* **Fix** –
  1️⃣ Reduce \`minReplicas\` to 0 or 1 where safe (\`kubectl patch hpa <svc> -p '{"spec":{"minReplicas":0}}'\`).  
  2️⃣ Enable **Cluster Autoscaler** (\`--scale-down-enabled=true\`).  
  3️⃣ Add a **node‑selector** to the DaemonSet to run only on a subset of nodes.  
  4️⃣ Monitor cost with **kubecost** charts to verify the drop.
* **Best‑practice checklist**  
  – Review all **HPAs** monthly for over‑provisioned \`minReplicas\`.  
  – Tag cloud resources with \`k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled\`.  
  – Use **Spot Instances** for non‑critical node pools.
